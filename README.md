# ESMethods
Codes belonging to Hooftman et al. Reducing uncertainty in Ecosystem Service modelling using Ensembles

Note: 3 braches. 

Main branch: ensemble generating and comparing as well as correlations between spatial drivers and uncertainty (Matlab)

Extraction tools: combining and cleaning data  for both models and validation sets (Matlab & arcpy)

DriverCorrelations: correlating 15 spatial drivers to spatial variation in among model and among ensemble variation (Matlab)
